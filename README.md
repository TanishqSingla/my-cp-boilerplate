# My CP Boilerplate
This file contains my shorthand syntax for competitive programming

## How to use
To use the file just include it in the top of your code file using:
```cpp
#include "boilerplate.h"
```
The file already contains the `bits/stdc++.h` so you don't have to include it in your code file.

If you want to manage headerfiles yourself, just add 
```cpp
#pragma once
```
at the top of `boilerplate.h`

***NOTE:*** the file contains `using namespace std;`, change as per your preference. Check for this note in case of namespace error.
